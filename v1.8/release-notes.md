# SCU Whitepaper v1.8 — Release Notes

**Edition:** v1.8  
**Type:** Architectural Publication  
**Status:** Current Canonical Edition  
**Publisher:** SCU Foundation

SCU Whitepaper v1.8 is the current canonical architectural definition of the **Superconducting Compute Unit (SCU)**.  
This edition refines the conceptual model, clarifies architectural boundaries, and updates the structural description of the SCU to reflect the most accurate and stable understanding of the hardware.

v1.8 supersedes v1.7 and should be used as the authoritative reference for all SCU‑related research, implementation, and analysis.

## Summary of Changes (Compared to v1.7)

### **Architectural Clarifications**
- Refined the definition of the SCU’s superconducting compute substrate  
- Clarified the relationship between physical, logical, and operational layers  
- Improved terminology consistency across architectural sections  
- Strengthened the description of SCU primitives and their interactions  

### **Structural Improvements**
- Updated diagrams to reflect corrected component boundaries  
- Reworked the explanation of superconducting pathways and data flow  
- Added clearer separation between control, compute, and interconnect layers  
- Consolidated redundant or ambiguous architectural descriptions  

### **Conceptual Refinements**
- Introduced more precise framing for the SCU’s role within compute systems  
- Clarified assumptions about superconducting behaviour and operational constraints  
- Improved explanations of timing, coherence, and stability considerations  

### **Document Quality Enhancements**
- Reorganised sections for improved readability and logical flow  
- Standardised formatting, terminology, and structural conventions  
- Added cross‑references for easier navigation  
- Removed outdated or transitional content from earlier drafts

## Notes

- v1.8 includes **both PDF and HTML editions**  
- This is the **first Ecosystem Era architectural edition**, but the content remains strictly focused on the SCU hardware  
- v1.8 is the **authoritative reference** for the SCU architecture  
- All future architectural updates will build on this edition

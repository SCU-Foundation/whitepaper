# Whitepaper Repository — Status

This repository contains the canonical archive of the SCU Whitepaper, including all published editions, metadata, and release notes.  
Whitepapers are institutional publications and provide conceptual, architectural, and governance context for the SCU ecosystem.

## Publication Status

Whitepapers are:

- **Canonical**
- **Versioned**
- **Archival**
- **Maintained by the SCU Foundation**
- **Part of the Institutional Publications Surface**

Whitepapers are not normative standards and do not define technical requirements.  
Technical specifications are maintained separately in the `specifications/` repository.

## Included Editions

- **v1.7** — Legacy stable edition  
- **v1.8** — Current canonical edition  

Earlier editions (v1.5, v1.6) are not included due to legacy‑era content and transitional proprietary material.

## Stewardship

The SCU Foundation is the neutral, non‑commercial steward of all whitepaper publications in this repository.

# SCU Foundation — Whitepaper Archive

This repository contains the canonical archive of the SCU Whitepaper, including all published editions, release notes, metadata, and associated publication materials.  
The SCU Whitepaper is the primary institutional publication of the SCU Foundation and provides conceptual, architectural, and governance context for the SCU ecosystem.

All editions are preserved for long‑term reference, citation, and public accessibility.

---

## Purpose

The Whitepaper Archive serves as the authoritative source for:

- published SCU Whitepaper editions  
- PDF and HTML releases  
- publication metadata  
- release notes and change summaries  
- archival preservation of superseded editions  

Whitepapers are **publications**, not standards, and do not define normative technical requirements.  
Technical specifications are maintained separately in the `specifications/` repository.
